1.) Identify your problem statement
2.) Tell basic info about the dataset (Total number of rows, columns)
3.) Mention the pre-processing method if you’re doing any (like converting
string to number – nominal data)
4.) Develop a good model with good evaluation metric. You can use any
machine learning algorithm; you can create many models. Finally, you
have to come up with final model.
5.) All the research values of each algorithm should be documented. (You
can make tabulation or screenshot of the results.)
6.) Mention your final model, justify why u have chosen the same.
